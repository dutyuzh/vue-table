# vue-table
Creating a dynamic table with the ability to add rows and columns. I have integrated this with draggable component (https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable) for the ability to drag/drop/reorder rows. 

# dependencies
1. "vue": "^2.5.16",
2. "bootstrap": "^4.1.1",
3. "vuedraggable": "^2.16.0",
